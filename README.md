# Hi there, I'm Tommii 👋

I'm an AI Engineer passionate about building intelligent, agentic systems that solve real-world problems. My focus is on the intersection of Large Language Models (LLMs), structured data, and complex workflows. I enjoy designing and implementing robust, production-ready AI solutions from the ground up.

---

### 🔭 I’m currently working on:

- **Agentic AI Workflows:** Building multi-agent systems with frameworks like LangGraph to orchestrate complex tasks, such as natural language to SQL generation, tool use, and permission-gated routing.
- **RAG & Structured Data:** Developing advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines that leverage vector databases (like Qdrant) to provide LLMs with contextual awareness of structured schemas and documentation.
- **Safety & Guardrails for LLMs:** Implementing safety layers to ensure generated outputs are secure, factually grounded, and reliable, especially when interacting with enterprise databases.

### 🌱 I’m currently learning:

- Advanced multi-modal models and their applications.
- Optimizing agentic systems for lower latency and cost.
- Formal verification methods for LLM-based systems.
